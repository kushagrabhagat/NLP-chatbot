Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer
The incidence of breast cancer is increasing in the developing world due to increasing life expectancy, increased urbanization, and adopting western lifestyles.
Kind of cancer:-
Invasive ductal carcinoma.--The cancer cells grow outside the ducts into other parts of the breast tissue. Invasive cancer cells can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body.
Invasive lobular carcinoma.--Cancer cells spread from the lobules to the breast tissues that are close by. These invasive cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body.

There are two early detection methods:
-early diagnosis or awareness of early signs and symptoms in symptomatic populations in order to facilitate diagnosis and early treatment, and
-screening that is the systematic application of a screening test in a presumably asymptomatic population. It aims to identify individuals with an abnormality suggestive of cancer.

Modifying or avoiding the following key risk factors can help prevent cancer:
-avoid tobacco use, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco
-maintain a healthy weight
-eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables
-exercise regularly
-limit alcohol use
-practice safe sex 
-get vaccinated against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV)
-reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation and ionizing radiation (occupational or medical diagnostic imaging)
-avoid urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels
-get regular medical care
-some chronic infections are also risk factors for cancer. People in low- and middle-income countries are more likely to develop cancer through chronic infections.
